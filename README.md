# Music Maker 

Music Maker is simple react app created by Abdurrahim Ahmadov for practice.
In this project i apply some features of react framework such as 

1. props, 
2. state, 
3. Rendering Elements
4. Components (parent and child, class and function base components)
5. Lifecycle methods
6. Handling Events
7. Conditional Rendering
8. Lists and Keys


I want to change some parts of the code in future for example: class components to hooks, lifecycle methods to useEffects(), state to useState() and so on.  


## Installation

Use the github cli  to clone Music Maker your local machine:


In the project directory, you can run:
```bash
  npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Usage
Open App and tap shown keys on app or keyboard, play music.( yes, I understand this music is meaningless but don't forget all is for practice, I don't have any music backgrounds:) )
